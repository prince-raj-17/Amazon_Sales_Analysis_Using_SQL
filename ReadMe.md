# Amazon Sales Data Analysis

This project aims to analyze sales data from three branches of Amazon located in Mandalay, Yangon, and Naypyitaw. The dataset contains information on sales transactions, including details such as invoice ID, branch, city, customer type, gender, product line, unit price, quantity, VAT, total cost, date, time, payment method, cost of goods sold, gross margin percentage, gross income, and rating.

## Purpose
The primary objective of this project is to gain insights into Amazon's sales data to understand various factors influencing sales across different branches. Through analysis, we aim to identify trends, patterns, and areas for improvement in sales strategies and customer segmentation.

## Approach
### 1. Data Wrangling
- Built a database and created tables to store the sales data.
- Inspected the data to detect and handle NULL values and missing data.
- Selected columns with NULL values, which were then filtered out as the tables were created with NOT NULL constraints.

### 2. Feature Engineering
- Added new columns such as `timeofday`, `dayname`, and `monthname` to provide insights into sales patterns based on time of day, day of the week, and month of the year, respectively.
